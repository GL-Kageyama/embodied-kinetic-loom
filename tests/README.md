# tests/

**Eight files, eighty tests, all green — measured 2026-09-27.**

**This file used to say there were none.** It changed in the same commit as the first test, which is the rule that section of `CLAUDE.md` states and this directory exists to hold.

## The five checks, and where each one lives

| # | the check | where it lives | ⚠️ what it also records |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1** | the ends: position, velocity and acceleration are zero at both ends | `test_profile.py`, `test_plan.py` | ⛔ **the trapezoid fails this** — its acceleration is not zero at the ends |
| **2** | limits are not exceeded, per axis **and combined** | `test_limits.py` | ⛔ **the trapezoid fails this too** — its jerk is undefined at the corners |
| **3** | reachability — the segments that vanish | `test_profile.py`, `test_admit.py` | **the odd one out: it handles the case where no correct trajectory exists** |
| **4** | determinism | `test_plan.py`, `test_purity.py` | comparing two runs is not enough — see below |
| **5** | Safety refuses what it should | `test_admit.py` | ⚠️ **the plan-time side only.** There is no run-time gate yet |

**Two of the five are negative claims, and they are the point.** The fallback profile is documented as a fallback; these tests record that **choosing it means turning a check off.** Without them that one check would go missing quietly.

## The check that is not one of the five

**`test_intent.py` holds the boundary from both sides.** The `quality` field of the type is accepted by the schema and ignored by the code — and both halves are asserted, because either half alone would let the boundary collapse. **On the day the vocabulary lands, the second half is rewritten, not deleted.**

## Why determinism is checked statically

**`test_purity.py` reads the imports of every file under `engine/` and fails if any is `random`, `time`, `os`, `socket`, or an LLM client.**

**Running the same input twice and comparing is not proof.** The two runs might simply have agreed. **The imports are the thing to look at**, and an AST finds them where a grep would find the word inside a docstring instead.

## The rule that holds this directory — applied to us

**`CLAUDE.md`'s Tests section must not say "nothing yet" while test files sit on disk.**

That state is not hypothetical — **a sister repository is in it right now**: seven test files and fifty-four tests on disk, and its `CLAUDE.md` still reads "not yet built". **So when the first test landed here, that section changed in the same commit.** A section that describes a directory rather than reading it is how that happens.

## What is checked today, and where

**The two checks that are not tests do not live here.**

- **`claude plugin validate --strict .`** — the manifest fields and the two versions against each other.
- **`python3 tools/check_i18n.py`** — the document mirrors. It has its own `--self-test`.

⚠️ **Together they see five of the fifteen conventions this repository follows. Nothing checks the other ten.**

## Running this directory

```
python3 -m pytest tests/
```

⚠️ **Green means the mechanism computes what it was told to compute.** It means nothing about whether anything is *there* — see `docs/verification-boundary.md`. **What is alive is not a thing a test can be written for.**
